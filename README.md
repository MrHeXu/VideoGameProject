# Programming in Java Video Game Project
Cosmin Ioan Capatina



Features : 
1. MAIN MENU
      I added the main menu when the game is opened the player can select from a variety of options ( START , SELECT LEVEL and QUIT ).
     1.1. If the player selects  START the game will start from level 1 as normal.
     1.2. If the player selects SELECT LEVEL the current menu will close and another window will pop up where the player can select from LEVEL 1 , LEVEL 2 and LEVEL 3 . Then starting at the respective choice.
     1.3. If the player selects QUIT the game will close.

	2. MUSIC
     2.1. I added background music for the 1st level and the 2nd and 3rd level have the same music.
     2.2. I added sound clips to most of the props and actions in the game ( jumping , picking up coins , hearts ).
	I added sound to each of the pickups. I was not that hard but because how I designed the code I had a bug with the sound of the 3rd level and the button from the menu selecting the 3rd level where if I would select the 3rd level there would be no sound . I fixed it by adding the sound to the button.
	
	3.BACKGROUND IMAGE – added a background image for level 1 , level 2 and level 3. I added the image to MyView class to the paintBackground method.

	4.RANDOM HEART – I added a new heart special from the normal ones. If the player picks this one up there is a 50/50 chance that the player will receive 2 hearts or will lose 1. The heart is present only in level 3. It was kind of hard for me to figure out how to perform the random generator but with some research I got it to work.

	The game is far, far from being complete or polished but I’m very happy with the progress that I have made considering this is my first year of programming ever. I really don’t think that I should score really good because smy code is not polished but I tried my best.
